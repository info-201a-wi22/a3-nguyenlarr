### Introduction
The US prison system is broken. It is the manifestation of the United States' deepest social and political issues. Overpolicing, the war on drugs, and a 
discriminant legal system has led to a disproportionate minority population in prison. Firstly, I am concerned with the difference between white and black 
incarcerated populations within Washington state. I found from subtracting the black incarcerated population from the white incarcerated population a difference of 
621.37. While this is not the largest difference, I found statistics from the Vera Institute of Justice that despite representing 70+ percent of the population in
Washington state, they only represent about 61 percent of the state’s incarcerated population. On the other hand, African Americans represent only five percent of 
the state’s population yet overwhelmingly represent 18 percent of the incarcerated population. I then wanted to look into the state with the largest proportion of 
incarcerated African Americans (Maryland)  and the state with the largest overall population of incarcerated African Americans (Georgia). Sticking to the theme of 
examining minority populations within incarcerated populations, I wanted to find the state with the largest population imprisoned by ICE, or the US Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement which is shockingly Maryland. I would’ve inferred that a state bordering Canada or Mexico has the largest proportion of individuals imprisoned
by ICE however this may be because of a Federal prison located in Maryland. Finally, I wanted to find out which county housed the most Latino inmates which ended up 
being Los Angeles County.
